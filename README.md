# Starting Template Framework
This repo is the starting template framework for .Net 5 projects(currently). Interfaces and some concrete applications already made for a quick start for the project. N-Layer architecture has been used for reusability, testing and seperation of concerns purposes. <br>
## Approaches
Clean architecure, Aspect Oriented Programming and SOLID principles were taken into account while developing/designing the infrastructure as well as CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).
